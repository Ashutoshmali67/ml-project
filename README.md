we will explore a dataset and understand which factors lead a person to leave their current job . Using this data, weâ€™ll conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns, and finally, build a model .
 
The maximum accuracy got as 76.29 % by using Logistic Regression and gradient boost classifier

Task Perform-:

 1.Read data

 2.clear all null value

 3.perform EDA

 4.perform some Analysis
 
 5.split into test,train ,split

 6.find accuracy using Logistic regression, Random Forest

 7.Hyperparameter Tune the models

 8.find the ROC Curve
 

Result -

The maximum accuracy got as 78.67 % by using gradient boosting Classifier . but we dont got proper f1-score hence we use smote (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). by using this we got better f1 score aand maximum accuracy got as 79.09 % by using gradient boosting Classifier .

 Conclusion -
 
 1. from small company size and having experience of junior and middle experience employees leaving the job , to find the new   job
 
2. male employees leaves their job more as compare to female employees.

4. most of the employees from early stage startup leave their job while employees work in public sector and , NGO have least   count of leave the job .
