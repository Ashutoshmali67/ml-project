we will explore a dataset and understand which factors lead a person to leave their current job . Using this data, weâ€™ll conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns, and finally, build a model .
 
The maximum accuracy got as 76.29 % by using Logistic Regression and gradient boost classifier

Task Perform-:

 1.Read data

 2.clear all null value

 3.perform EDA

 4.perform some Analysis
 
 5.split into test,train ,split

 6.find accuracy using Logistic regression, Random Forest

 7.Hyperparameter Tune the models

 8.find the ROC Curve
 

Result -:
The maximum accuracy got as 79.02 % by using Logistic Regression.

Conclusion-


1. from above graphs we conclude that employees having 1 or 2 years experience leave therir job. 

2. employees working in public sector and NGO they may not be leave their job while employees working in Early Stage Startup   may be  leave their job .
